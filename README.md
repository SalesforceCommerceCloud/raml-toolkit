## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @commerce-apps/raml-toolkit
```

## Usage

The npm installs the binaries as both `raml-toolkit` and `ramlint` and they can be used interchangeably.  You can always run with `--help` to get available options, currently the options are as follows.

### Commands

**Note:** Some commands require environment variables to be set. This can be done using a [.env file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#rules) in your working directory (the directory from which you run `raml-toolkit`).

<!-- commands -->

- [`raml-toolkit download`](#raml-toolkit-download)
- [`raml-toolkit lint [FILENAME]`](#raml-toolkit-lint-filename)

#### `raml-toolkit diff BASE NEW`

Compute the difference between two API specifications

```txt
USAGE
  $ raml-toolkit diff BASE NEW

ARGUMENTS
  BASE  The base API spec file (ruleset / diff-only mode) or directory
  NEW   The new API spec file (ruleset / diff-only mode) or directory

OPTIONS
  -f, --format=(json|console)                        Format of the output. Defaults to JSON if --out-file is specified,
                                                  otherwise console text.

  -o, --out-file=out-file                         File to store the computed difference

  -r, --ruleset=ruleset                           [default:@commerce-apps/raml-toolkit/resources/diff/rules/defaultRules
                                                  ] Path to ruleset to apply to diff

  --diff-only                                     Only show differences without evaluating a ruleset

  --dir                                           Find the differences for all files in two directories

  --log-level=trace|debug|info|warn|error|silent  [default: info] Set the level of detail in the output

DESCRIPTION
  This command has three modes: ruleset, diff-only, and directory.
     Ruleset mode (default) compares two files and applies a ruleset to determine if any changes are breaking.
     Diff-only mode compares two files to determine if there are any differences, without applying a ruleset.
     Directory mode compares all the files in two directories and determines if there are any differences.

  In ruleset and diff-only mode, the arguments must be API specification (RAML) files.
  In directory mode, the arguments must be directories containing API specification (RAML) files.

  Exit statuses:
     0 - No breaking changes (ruleset mode) or no differences (diff-only / directory)
     1 - Breaking changes (ruleset mode) or differences found (diff only / directory)
     2 - Evaluation could not be completed
```

#### `raml-toolkit download`

Download API specification files from Anypoint Exchange

```txt
USAGE
  $ raml-toolkit download

OPTIONS
  -D, --deployment=deployment                      [default: .] Deployment status to filter results from Anypoint
                                                   Exchange

  -d, --dest=dest                                  [default: apis] Directory to download APIs into

  -s, --search=search                              Search query to filter results from Anypoint Exchange

  --deployment-regex-flags=deployment-regex-flags  RegExp flags to specify for advanced deployment matching

  --log-level=trace|debug|info|warn|error|silent   [default: info] Set the level of detail in the output
```

#### `raml-toolkit lint [FILENAME]`

A linting tool for raml for Commerce Cloud and beyond

```txt
USAGE
  $ raml-toolkit lint [FILENAME]

ARGUMENTS
  FILENAME  One or more RAML files to lint

OPTIONS
  -p, --profile=(mercury|slas)                    (required) Profile to apply
  -w, --warnings                                  Show all the warnings
  --log-level=trace|debug|info|warn|error|silent  [default: info] Set the level of detail in the output
```
<!-- commandsstop -->

### Jenkins

In your Jenkinsfile, init npm and then it's a simple one line command

  ```groovy
    stage('Init') {
        // Needed only for SFCI instances to add npm to the instance
        npmInit()
    }

    stage('Whatever') {
        sh "npx raml-toolkit lint --profile mercury file1.raml file2.raml etc.raml"
    }
  ```

NOTE: Violations will return a non-zero exit code and fail the build, which warnings will still return a 0 exit code so the build will not fail with warnings

### From your local machine

To check your RAML currently the CLI just takes a list of files

```bash
$ ramlint lint --profile mercury file.raml
# or
$ ramlint lint --profile mercury file1.raml file2.raml etc.raml
```

The response will look something like

```txt
Model: file://data-products-api-v1.raml
Profile: mercury
Conforms? false
Number of results: 2

Level: Violation

- Source: http://a.ml/vocabularies/data#require-api-description
  Message: The API Description must be set
  Level: Violation
  Target: file://data-products-api-v1.raml#/web-api
  Property: http://schema.org/description
  Position: Some(LexicalInformation([(2,0)-(1885,0)]))
  Location: file://data-products-api-v1.raml

- Source: http://a.ml/vocabularies/data#version-format
  Message: The version must be formatted as v[Major], for example v2
  Level: Violation
  Target: file://data-products-api-v1.raml#/web-api
  Property: http://schema.org/version
  Position: Some(LexicalInformation([(3,9)-(3,11)]))
  Location: file://data-products-api-v1.raml

 â€º   Error: ./data-products-api-v1.raml is invalid
```

Let us look more closely at each of these errors.

The first error is saying that the API description is not set, but we need to have it set according to our standards.  There is a "Position:" field in the response, but it is saying 2-1885. This happens to be the entire RAML document. Ranges like this will be common for "Missing" components since the parser doesn't know where you want to put it, but knows you need to put it somewhere.

The second error, however, is because it exists, but doesn't match our standard.  There you can see that the position leads you to the exact line number and column of the non-conforming component.

When there are no more violations, the output will say it conforms, but also provide you with some warnings you might want to fix as well.

### Exchange Connector

This package also contains the code formerly published under `@commerce-apps/exchange-connector`. There are no breaking changes between the last version of `@commerce-apps/exchange-connector` and v0.3.0 of this package. For changes since then, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
