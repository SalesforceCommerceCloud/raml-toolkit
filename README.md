## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @commerce-apps/raml-toolkit
```

## Usage

The npm installs the binaries as both `raml-toolkit` and `ramlint` and they can be used interchangeably.  You can always run with `--help` to get available options, currently the options are as follows.

```bash
OPTIONS
  -h, --help                                show CLI help
  -p, --profile=(mercury, other-profile) profile to apply
  -v, --version                             show CLI version
  -w, --warnings                   Show all the warnings
```

### Jenkins

In your Jenkinsfile just make sure you init npm and then its a very simple one line command

  ```groovy
    stage('Init') {
        // Needed only for SFCI instances to add npm to the instance
        npmInit()
    }

    stage('Whatever') {
        sh "npx raml-toolkit --profile mercury file1.raml file2.raml etc.raml"
    }
  ```

NOTE: Violations will return a non-zero exit code and fail the build, which warnings will still return a 0 exit code so the build will not fail with warnings

### From your local machine

To check your RAML currently the CLI just takes a list of files

```bash
$ ramlint --profile mercury file.raml
# or
$ ramlint --profile mercury file1.raml file2.raml etc.raml
```

The response will look something like

```
Model: file://data-products-api-v1.raml
Profile: mercury
Conforms? false
Number of results: 2

Level: Violation

- Source: http://a.ml/vocabularies/data#require-api-description
  Message: The API Description must be set
  Level: Violation
  Target: file://data-products-api-v1.raml#/web-api
  Property: http://schema.org/description
  Position: Some(LexicalInformation([(2,0)-(1885,0)]))
  Location: file://data-products-api-v1.raml

- Source: http://a.ml/vocabularies/data#version-format
  Message: The version must be formatted as v[Major], for example v2
  Level: Violation
  Target: file://data-products-api-v1.raml#/web-api
  Property: http://schema.org/version
  Position: Some(LexicalInformation([(3,9)-(3,11)]))
  Location: file://data-products-api-v1.raml

 â€º   Error: ./data-products-api-v1.raml is invalid
```

Let us look more closely at each of these errors.

The first error is saying that the API description is not set, but we need to have it set according to our standards.  There is a "Position:" field in the response, but it is saying 2-1885. This happens to be the entire RAML document. Ranges like this will be common for "Missing" components since the parser doesn't know where you want to put it, but knows you need to put it somewhere.

The second error, however, is because it exists, but doesn't match our standard.  There you can see that the position leads you to the exact line number and column of the non-conforming component.

When there are no more violations, the output will say it conforms, but also provide you with some warnings you might want to fix as well.

### Exchange Connector

This package also contains the code formerly published under `@commerce-apps/exchange-connector`. There are no breaking changes between the last version of `@commerce-apps/exchange-connector` and v0.3.0 of this package. For changes since then, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
